@article{hippel_2010, title={Comparing Business and Household Sector Innovation in Consumer Products: Findings from a Representative Study in the UK}, url={http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1683503}, abstractNote={In a first survey of its type, we measure development and modification of consumer products by product users in a representative sample of 1,173 UK consumers aged 18 and over. We find this previously unmeasured type of household sector innovation to be quite large: 6.2% of UK consumers - 2.9 million individuals - have engaged in consumer product innovation during the prior 3 years. In aggregate, consumers annual product development expenditures are 2.3 times larger than the annual consumer product R&D expenditures of all firms in the UK combined. We report upon consumer-innovators expenditure patterns, demographic variables, and motivations. We also explore the diffusion of the innovations consumers generate, and discuss the complementary nature of consumer and producer innovation efforts. We conclude by suggesting avenues for further research regarding this apparently major phenomenon.}, number={September}, journal={Social Science Research Network}, author={Von Hippel, Eric and De Jong, Jeroen and Flowers, Steven}, year={2010}, pages={1-39}}
