	Findings from a Representative Study in the UK},

  year = {2010},
  pages = {1-39},
  number = {September},
  abstractnote = {In a first survey of its type, we measure development and modification
	of consumer products by product users in a representative sample
	of 1,173 UK consumers aged 18 and over. We find this previously unmeasured
	type of household sector innovation to be quite large: 6.2% of UK
	consumers - 2.9 million individuals - have engaged in consumer product
	innovation during the prior 3 years. In aggregate, consumers annual
	product development expenditures are 2.3 times larger than the annual
	consumer product R&D expenditures of all firms in the UK combined.
	We report upon consumer-innovators expenditure patterns, demographic
	variables, and motivations. We also explore the diffusion of the
	innovations consumers generate, and discuss the complementary nature
	of consumer and producer innovation efforts. We conclude by suggesting
	avenues for further research regarding this apparently major phenomenon.},

  title = {On the Function of Cowries in Shang and Western Zhou China},
  journal = {Journal of East Asian Archaeology},
  year = {January 2003},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {1--26(26)},
  abstract = {Cowrie shells are often found in Bronze Age sites in China. The commonly
	accepted explanation for their function is that they were used as
	money or currency during the Shang and the Zhou periods, if not as
	early as the Neolithic. References to cowrie shells in Shang and
	Zhou bronze inscriptions and in received classical texts are often
	regarded as evidence for such an interpretation. This paper reviews
	the hypothesis that cowries were money and examines textual evidence
	commonly cited in support of the hypothesis. It argues that a number
	of different concepts, such as wealth, value, and money, are often
	misleadingly conflated in the discussion of "cowrie money," and that
	some of the textual references to cowries have been misinterpreted.
	The paper suggests that, on present evidence, cowries began to assume
	the role of a standard of value only during the Middle Western Zhou
	period. The main function of cowries in the Shang and Western Zhou
	periods is more likely to have been ornamental, funerary, or ritual.},
