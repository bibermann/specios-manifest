## Notes

### German umlaut in headers

Headers with german umlaut characters
that are visible in the TOC for the current page
must have a reference without special characters like so:

```md
## Arbeits-Kapazit√§ten {#sec-implementation-work-capacities}
```

Then the HTML anchor will undertake this name 
and looks like `#sec-implementation-work-capacities`,
otherwise it will get `#arbeits-kapazit%C3%A4ten`
and then the highlighting in the TOC does not work when scrolling.

The implementation probably uses the scrollspy from bootstrap,
but I haven't found anything about this bug.
So we need to use this workaround.
